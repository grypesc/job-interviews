## OOP
#### Terms
* Encapsulation (hiding data implementation by restricting access to public methods)
* Abstraction (Abstract means a concept or an Idea which is not associated with any particular instance)
  * Interface (declares methods of a class that will implement it)
  * Abstract class
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism (Static polymorphism is achieved using method overloading and dynamic polymorphism using method overriding)
